        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cannoli is a traditional recipe that was created in Sicily. The outer shell is made up of a pastry 
            while the inside filling can be made up of various mixes (usually cheese and vanilla). Some like to 
            add topping on the openings.
